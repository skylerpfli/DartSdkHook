**Describe the rule you'd like to see implemented**
Include as much detail as you can. 

This should include a description of who would use the lint (such as if it's
specific to a framework like Flutter), what conditions the rule should look
for, and what conditions the rule should ignore.

**Examples**

Ideally, provide motivating examples w/ rationale.

**Additional context**
Add any other considerations or context here.
